Probability Distribution
=======================

This package can be used to create noise with certain probability distributions.

It can generate sets of values with different with either uniform, Gaussian or Poisson distribution.

It can also apply the generated values at an input signal in input to simulate a noise.

An additional filter class can be used to recover the original by first applying a Fast Fourier Transform, the use high-pass or low-pass before recovering the signal using the reverse Fast Fourier Transform.
